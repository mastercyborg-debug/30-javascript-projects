# 30 JavaScript Projects
This collection features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects created by Iwa Samuel Oluwasegun. Feel free to explore the source codes and use them for your own projects. While testing the video player, I encountered an issue with the file size of the video, which is too large to upload. In the meantime, you can test the player using a local file on your system. I plan to update the code with a smaller file soon. Your feedback and suggestions are valuable, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email, Facebook, GitHub, or WhatsApp. Thank you for your interest!.  Please feel free to download and use the code or modify it. You can contact me using the abovementioned platforms if you have any suggestions. I would love to hear your feedback.

Thank you
